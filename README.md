# Cache Mapping Simulator

A Python-based simulator to demonstrate different cache mapping techniques in Computer Organization and Architecture (COA).

## Features

- Simulates cache memory operations
- Supports different cache mapping techniques
- Visualizes memory block to cache mapping using animation

## Files

- `cache_mapping.py` – Core logic for simulating cache mapping
- `animation.py` – Visualization of cache mapping process

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib` (for animation)

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

### How to run
To run the simulation:
```bash
python cache_mapping.py
```
To run the animation:
```bash
python animation.py
```

#### Developed as part of a Computer Organization and Architecture (COA) project.
